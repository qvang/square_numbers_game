Game is completed.

C++ 20 or above only.
To play the game:

    The user enters a guess.
    If the guess matches any generated value, the value is removed from the list and the user gets to guess again.
    If the user guesses all of the generated values, they win.
    If the guess does not match a generated value, the user loses and the program tells them the nearest unguessed value.
